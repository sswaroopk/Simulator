# Simulator
### Note: This is an ongoing project. Documentaition for models is still to be written. This is not a complete process simulator yet.
This is a respository for a dynamic chemical process simulator in OpenModelica based on Modelica Language.
The main files are described as below
## Chemsep_Database
This package contains data for several compounds.

## Functions
This package contains functions that take inputs from database and give repsective outputs like density at given temperature etc.

## unitoperations
This package contains models for some unitoperations.

## unitoperationsTest
This contains examples that use unitoperations.

## Benzeneproduction
This package contains flowsheet for benzene production from dealkylation of toluene.
